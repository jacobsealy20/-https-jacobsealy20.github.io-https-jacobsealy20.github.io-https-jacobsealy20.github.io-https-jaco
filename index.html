Players dressed in character for a LARP event
A live action role-playing game (LARP) is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically portray their characters.[1] The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world while interacting with each other in character. The outcome of player actions may be mediated by game rules or determined by consensus among players. Event arrangers called gamemasters decide the setting and rules to be used and facilitate play.

If you’re reading this, you’ve already made one choice—you want to drive a land-based RC vehicle. That was the easiest of your choices and it only gets harder from here. Let’s take a look at some of the questions: Will you be driving indoors or outdoors. Do you want the ease and consistency of electric or the smell and sound of nitro? Big RC’s or small? What about 2WD or 4WD? Are you an off-road buggy-type of guy, a lover of monster trucks or want something that can slice and dice around corners while going maximum speed? Bet you never thought there’d be that many questions, huh?

Well thankfully you have RC Driver to help you make some of the most important decisions in your life (your RC life, that is). We’ve compiled a pretty extensive list of all the racing/bashing classes available at the moment. Read along, and good luck with your decision!</p></div>
